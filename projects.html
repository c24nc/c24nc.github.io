	<a href="finalproject.html" target="_blank"><h1 id="heading1">My Final Comp Sci Story Presentation!</h1></a>

	<p id="text">In class we had to do slideshow presentations, so I decided to create a page on my website dedicated to this presentation so I can display it. In these last few weeks of comp sci, we were beginning to create final projects; these projects were supposed to be stories in the form of slideshows.The story presentations were meant to be about “something we learned and did, why it matters to us, and our understanding of how it works.” These stories could be about anything; this could include the inspiration of our codesketches, common themes in our codesketches, the evolution of our work, our mistakes or mistrials, work that never came to be (such as unfinished codesketches, ideas that never ended written down in code, etc.), and even to highlight things that we learned. Hope you enjoy!!

	<a href="rainbow.html" target="_blank"><h1 id="heading1">Random Color Picker *WARNING: potential flashing lights!*</h1></a>

	<p id="text">In this codesketch, I coded so that every time you press the button in the middle of the screen, the background of the website changes colors. This codesketch uses a feature in javascript called Math.random, where it gives you a number within the range of 0 to 1, which you can then “scale to your desired range” by multiplying a certain number to it. In this case, I made the random numbers between 0 and 225, and let them be in the place of the rgb (red green blue) color model, since each number is a combination of a red, green, and blue-- each between 0 and 225. For example, the background color of this website is rgb(173, 216, 230). So in the codesketch I randomized each number in order to get a random color, and coded an event listener to change the color each time you click the button.

	<a href="aquarium.html" target="_blank"><h1 id="heading1">The Aquarium!</h1></a>

	<p id="text">In my aquarium codesketch, I coded it so that when you press one of the buttons in the top left, it creates a picture of a sea creature that pops up on the screen. On top of just showing up on the screen, when the picture is created, it is given a random coordinate on the screen each second, allowing it to "swim" randomly. Everytime you press the buttons, another sea creature appears in the aquarium!</p>

	<a href="thanksgiving.html" target="_blank"><h1 id="heading1">What I'm Thankful For</h1></a>

	<p id="text">In my thanksgiving codesketch, I coded it so that every time you press the box in the middle of the screen, you are able to see something that I am thankful for. This codesketch uses arrays to randomly select one of the many things that I am thankful for from a list and displays it on screen.</p>

	<p id="text">This was one of the first pieces of code we did with javascript! We all had to make one to use and display on our class website. We were given a template to customize and this was my result!!</p>
